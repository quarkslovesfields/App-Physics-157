# App-Physics-157
This is a repository of projects done in **App Physics 157**, officially *Computational Analysis and Modeling in Physics*. 

## Projects under this Folder:
1. Percolation = This project works with randomized cellular automata and studies how likely a state (e.g. water breaking through rock, or rock fracturing laterally) is going to span the space, given occupation probability, that is, the threshold below which a cell of a lattice is in occupied state (this is the one that is analogously filled by fracture or water in a rock).
**Skills**: Cellular Automata, Conditionals, For-loop statements
